# Automobile Data Analysis Dashboard  

## About the Project  
This project presents an *automobile dashboard* that provides a comprehensive analysis of various parameters influencing car performance, pricing, and efficiency. By analyzing key factors such as *engine size, horsepower, fuel type, vehicle weight, and wheelbase*, this dashboard helps in identifying industry trends and correlations.  

## Project Objectives  
- Develop a *data visualization dashboard* to analyze automobile specifications and trends.  
- Explore *fuel efficiency, pricing, and engine performance* across different brands.  
- Identify the impact of *weight, drive-wheel type, and engine characteristics* on fuel economy and performance.  
- Provide insights to *car manufacturers, buyers, and analysts* for informed decision-making.  

## Key Features and Analysis  

### 1. Car Brands and Fuel Type Distribution  
- Categorizes different automobile brands based on the fuel type they use.  
- Helps in understanding trends in petrol, diesel, and alternative fuel sources.  

### 2. Engine Size by Brand  
- Compares average engine size for different car brands.  
- Highlights brands prioritizing fuel efficiency vs. high performance.  

### 3. Engine Placement (Front vs. Rear)  
- Analyzes the impact of *engine placement* on stability and vehicle handling.  
- Most vehicles have front-engine placement, while sports cars often have rear-engine designs.  

### 4. Car Body Type and Price Analysis  
- Examines how car body types (sedan, hatchback, SUV, coupe, convertible) impact pricing.  
- Highlights differences in affordability across vehicle categories.  

### 5. Horsepower: Turbo vs. Standard Engines  
- Compares horsepower of *turbocharged* and *standard engines*.  
- Evaluates performance advantages of turbo engines.  

### 6. Correlation Between Engine Size and Price  
- Analyzes the relationship between *engine size* and *car pricing*.  
- Larger engines often lead to higher vehicle prices due to power and engineering factors.  

### 7. Fuel Efficiency vs. Engine Size  
- Studies the trade-off between *engine size and fuel consumption*.  
- Larger engines generally result in lower fuel efficiency.  

### 8. Impact of Vehicle Weight on Highway Mileage  
- Heavy cars tend to have lower highway mileage compared to lighter vehicles.  
- Helps manufacturers balance weight and fuel efficiency.  

### 9. Drive-Wheel Type Across Brands  
- Categorizes vehicles into *Front-Wheel Drive (FWD), Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), and All-Wheel Drive (AWD)*.  
- Examines how different brands implement drive-wheel configurations.  

### 10. City MPG and Engine Types  
- Compares city fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) across *different engine types*.  
- Helps urban commuters understand which cars provide the best mileage.  

### 11. Compression Ratio and Engine Size by Fuel Type  
- Explores how *compression ratios* vary across engine sizes and fuel types.  
- Higher compression ratios improve efficiency but may require premium fuel.  

### 12. Market Average Car Price  
- Provides an overview of the *average car price in the market*.  
- Helps buyers set realistic expectations when purchasing a vehicle.  

### 13. Maximum Wheelbase on Roads  
- Analyzes *wheelbase trends* across different vehicle categories.  
- Longer wheelbases generally improve ride comfort and stability.  

### 14. Median RPM Across Automobiles  
- Evaluates *median RPM values* across different vehicle types.  
- Ensures a balanced RPM for efficient fuel consumption and smooth driving.
